# MCKR-Project
This is a repository to keep the computation codes of the examples of the paper "Kac-Rice formulas and the number of solutions of parametrized systems of polynomial equations" [1]. For each example of the paper, there is one folder containing the computation files associated to the example. The reported timing in the paper are related to these files. The files are written in Maple, C++, Python and Julia. The extension suffix of a file determines which programming/software environment it is written in, but to make it easier to recognize, name of the environment is included at the beginning of the file name.
