This is the repository for the computation files of the examples of the paper "Kac-Rice formulas and the number of solutions of parametrized systems of polynomial equations" [1]. 

There is a folder for each example containing the associated computation files used to generate the results and times reported in the manuscript. The code files are written in Maple, C++, Python and Julia. The extension suffix and the prefix of the file name determine the programming/software environment.
